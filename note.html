      <h2>Editor’s Note</h2>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming a powerful tool in modern education. 
        From intelligent tutoring systems to automated grading, AI helps schools and 
        universities improve learning efficiency and accessibility. It allows students 
        to receive personalized lessons based on their strengths and weaknesses, making 
        education more inclusive and adaptive.
      </p>
      <p>
        As technology continues to evolve, AI is reshaping traditional classrooms into 
        smart learning environments. While challenges such as data privacy and ethical 
        concerns remain, the potential benefits of AI in education are undeniable. When 
        used responsibly, AI can support teachers, enhance student engagement, and prepare 
        learners for a technology-driven future.

      <h2>Author’s Insights</h2>
      <p>
        In my opinion, Artificial Intelligence should be seen as a support system rather 
        than a replacement for teachers. Human interaction, guidance, and values are still 
        essential in education. AI works best when it assists educators by reducing their 
        workload and giving them more time to focus on meaningful teaching.
      </p>
      <p>
        As students, we must also learn how to use AI responsibly. Understanding its limits 
        and ethical use will help us benefit from technology without depending on it too 
        much. Education should always aim to develop critical thinking, not just automation.
