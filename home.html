    <p style="color:white;">
        The <b>Aswang</b> is a shapeshifting, evil creature from Filipino folklore, serving as an umbrella term for various monsters like vampires, ghouls, and human-beast hybrids, known for preying on humans, especially the unborn, using a long tongue to suck out organs or blood, and appearing as normal people by day to blend in. Popular in the Visayas region (like Capiz), Aswang legends involve distinct types like the Manananggal (a severed torso) and are used in stories, arts, and films, influencing daily life with warnings and protective talismans like garlic and salt.

    <p style="color:white;">
        In the world of the Aswang, you will enter a land where fear walks with the night. As darkness falls, the wind grows silent, and shadows begin to move, the Aswang awakens. You will hear whispers in the trees and footsteps that vanish before you can turn around. Villages sleep in fear, for the Aswang hunts when the moon is high.

    <p style="color:white;">
        But the Aswang is more than just a monster. It is a symbol of the unknown, a warning of what happens when darkness is left unchecked. Some say it can change form, becoming an animal or even a human, hiding among the people. Those who cross its path must be brave, wise, and careful.
